# cscript

> Applies to: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012

Starts a script to run in a command-line environment.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Performing this task does not require you to have administrative credentials. Therefore, as a security best practice, consider performing this task as a user without administrative credentials.

## Syntax

```
cscript <scriptname.extension> [/b] [/d] [/e:<engine>] [{/h:cscript | /h:wscript}] [/i] [/job:<identifier>] [{/logo | /nologo}] [/s] [/t:<seconds>] [x] [/u] [/?] [<scriptarguments>]
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| scriptname.extension | Specifies the path and file name of the script file with optional file name extension. |
| /b | Specifies batch mode, which does not display alerts, scripting errors, or input prompts. |
| /d | Starts the debugger. |
| /e:`<engine>` | Specifies the engine that is used to run the script. |
| /h:cscript | Registers cscript.exe as the default script host for running scripts. |
| /h:wscript | Registers wscript.exe as the default script host for running scripts. This is the default. |
| /i | Specifies interactive mode, which displays alerts, scripting errors, and input prompts. This is the default and the opposite of `/b`. |
| /job:<identifier> | Runs the job identified by *identifier* in a .wsf script file. |
| /logo | Specifies that the Windows Script Host banner is displayed in the console before the script runs. This is the default and the opposite of `/nologo`. |
| /nologo | Specifies that the Windows Script Host banner is not displayed before the script runs. |
| /s | Saves the current command-prompt options for the current user. |
| /t:<seconds> | Specifies the maximum time the script can run (in seconds). You can specify up to 32,767 seconds. The default is no time limit. |
| /u | Specifies Unicode for input and output that is redirected from the console. |
| /x | Starts the script in the debugger. |
| /? | Displays available command parameters and provides help for using them. This is the same as typing **cscript.exe** with no parameters and no script. |
| scriptarguments | Specifies the arguments passed to the script. Each script argument must be preceded by a slash (**/**). |

#### Remarks

- Each parameter is optional; however, you can't specify script arguments without specifying a script. If you don't specify a script or any script arguments, cscript.exe displays the cscript.exe syntax and the valid host options.

- The **/t** parameter prevents excessive running of scripts by setting a timer. When the run time exceeds the specified value, cscript interrupts the script engine and ends the process.

- Windows script files usually have one of the following file name extensions: .wsf, .vbs, .js. Windows Script Host can use .wsf script files. Each .wsf file can use multiple scripting engines and perform multiple jobs.

- if you double-click a script file with an extension that has no association, the **Open With** dialog box appears. Select wscript or cscript, and then select **Always use this program to open this file type**. This registers wscript.exe or cscript as the default script host for files of this file type.

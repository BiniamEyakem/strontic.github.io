## rdpsign

> Applies to: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012

Enables you to digitally sign a Remote Desktop Protocol (.rdp) file.

> [!NOTE]
> To find out what's new in the latest version, see [What's New in Remote Desktop Services in Windows Server](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/dn283323(v=ws.11)).

### Syntax

```
rdpsign /sha1 <hash> [/q | /v |] [/l] <file_name.rdp>
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|--|--|
| /sha1 `<hash>` | Specifies the thumbprint, which is the Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA1) hash of the signing certificate that is included in the certificate store. Used in Windows Server 2012 R2 and older. |
| /sha256 `<hash>` | Specifies the thumbprint, which is the Secure Hash Algorithm 256 (SHA256) hash of the signing certificate that is included in the certificate store. Replaces /sha1 in Windows Server 2016 and newer. |
| /q | Quiet mode. No output when the command succeeds and minimal output if the command fails. |
| /v | verbose mode. Displays all warnings, messages, and status. |
| /l | Tests the signing and output results without actually replacing any of the input files. |
| `<file_name.rdp>` | The name of the .rdp file. You must specify the .rdp file (or files) to sign by using the full file name. Wildcard characters are not accepted. |
| /? | Displays help at the command prompt. |

##### Remarks

- The SHA1 or SHA256 certificate thumbprint should represent a trusted .rdp file publisher. To obtain the certificate thumbprint, open the **Certificates** snap-in, double-click the certificate that you want to use (either in the local computer's certificates store or in your personal certificates store), click the **details** tab, and then in the **Field** list, click **Thumbprint**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When you copy the thumbprint for use with the rdpsign.exe tool, you must remove any spaces.

- The signed output files overwrite the input files.

- If multiple files are specified, and if any of the .rdp files can't be read or written to, the tool continues to the next file.

#### Examples

To sign an .rdp file named *file1.rdp*, navigate to the folder where you saved the .rdp file, and then type:

```
rdpsign /sha1 hash file1.rdp
```

> [!NOTE]
> The *hash* value represents the SHA1 certificate thumbprint, without any spaces.

To test whether digital signing will succeed for an .rdp file without actually signing the file, type:

```
rdpsign /sha1 hash /l file1.rdp
```

To sign multiple .rdp files that are named, *file1.rdp*, *file2.rdp*, and *file3.rdp*, type (including the spaces between file names):

```
rdpsign /sha1 hash file1.rdp file2.rdp file3.rdp
```

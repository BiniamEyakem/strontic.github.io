# attrib

Displays, sets, or removes attributes assigned to files or directories. If used without parameters, **attrib** displays attributes of all files in the current directory.

## Syntax

```
attrib [{+|-}r] [{+|-}a] [{+|-}s] [{+|-}h] [{+|-}i] [<drive>:][<path>][<filename>] [/s [/d] [/l]]
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `{+|-}r` | Sets (**+**) or clears (**-**) the Read-only file attribute. |
| `{+\|-}a` | Sets (**+**) or clears (**-**) the Archive file attribute. This attribute set marks files that have changed since the last time they were backed up. Note that the **xcopy** command uses archive attributes. |
| `{+\|-}s` | Sets (**+**) or clears (**-**) the System file attribute. If a file uses this attribute set, you must clear the attribute before you can change any other attributes for the file. |
| `{+\|-}h` | Sets (**+**) or clears (**-**) the Hidden file attribute. If a file uses this attribute set, you must clear the attribute before you can change any other attributes for the file. |
| `{+\|-}i` | Sets (**+**) or clears (**-**) the Not Content Indexed file attribute. |
| `[<drive>:][<path>][<filename>]` | Specifies the location and name of the directory, file, or group of files for which you want to display or change attributes.<p>You can use the **?** and **&#42;** wildcard characters in the *filename* parameter to display or change the attributes for a group of files. |
| /s | Applies **attrib** and any command-line options to matching files in the current directory and all of its subdirectories. |
| /d | Applies **attrib** and any command-line options to directories. |
| /l | Applies **attrib** and any command-line options to the Symbolic Link, rather than the target of the Symbolic Link. |
| /? | Displays help at the command prompt. |

## Examples

```
attrib news86
```

To assign the Read-only attribute to the file named report.txt, type:

```

To remove the Read-only attribute from files in the public directory and its subdirectories on a disk in drive b:, type:

```
attrib -r b:\public\*.* /s
```

To set the Archive attribute for all files on drive a:, and then clear the Archive attribute for files with the .bak extension, type:

```

Older installations on remote machines may not support compression so it is off by default.<p>Default setting is off, since older installations on remote machines may not support compression.                                                                           |

Specifying this instead of the transport **https:** will use the default **WinRM** default port.                                                                                                                |

### Remarks
-   All command-line options accept either short form or long form. For example both **/r** and **/remote** are valid.
-   To terminate the **/remote** command, the user can type **Ctrl-C** or **Ctrl-break**, which will be sent to the remote shell. The second **Ctrl-C** will force termination of **winrs.exe**.
-   To manage active remote shells or winrs configuration, use the WinRM tool.  The URI alias to manage active shells is **shell/cmd**.  The URI alias for winrs configuration is **winrm/config/winrs**.

### Examples
```
winrs /r:https://contoso.com command
```
```
winrs /r:contoso.com /usessl command
```
```

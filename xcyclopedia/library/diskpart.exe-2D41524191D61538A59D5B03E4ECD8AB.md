## diskpart

>Applies to: Windows Server 2022, Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2008

The diskpart command interpreter helps you manage your computer's drives (disks, partitions, volumes, or virtual hard disks).

Before you can use **diskpart** commands, you must first list, and then select an object to give it focus. After an object has focus, any diskpart commands that you type will act on that object.

### List available objects

You can list the available objects and determine an object's number or drive letter by using:

- `list disk` - Displays all the disks on the computer.

- `list volume` - Displays all the volumes on the computer.

- `list partition` - Displays the partitions on the disk that has focus on the computer.

- `list vdisk` - Displays all the virtual disks on the computer.

After you run the **list** commands, an asterisk (*) appears next to the object with focus.

### Determine focus

When you select an object, the focus remains on that object until you select a different object. For example, if the focus is set on disk 0 and you select volume 8 on disk 2, the focus shifts from disk 0 to disk 2, volume 8.

Some commands automatically change the focus. For example, when you create a new partition, the focus automatically switches to the new partition.

You can only give focus to a partition on the selected disk. After a partition has focus, the related volume (if any) also has focus. After a volume has focus, the related disk and partition also have focus if the volume maps to a single specific partition. If this isn't the case, focus on the disk and partition is lost.

### Syntax

To start the diskpart command interpreter, at the command prompt type:

```
diskpart <parameter>
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must be in your local **Administrators** group, or a group with similar permissions, to run diskpart.

#### Parameters

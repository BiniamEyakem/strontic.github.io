# mmc

> Applies to: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012

Using mmc command-line options, you can open a specific **mmc** console, open **mmc** in author mode, or specify that the 32-bit or 64-bit version of **mmc** is opened.

## Syntax

```
mmc <path>\<filename>.msc [/a] [/64] [/32]
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `<path>\<filename>.msc` | starts **mmc** and opens a saved console. You need to specify the complete path and file name for the saved console file. If you do not specify a console file, **mmc** opens a new console. |
| /a | Opens a saved console in author mode.  Used to make changes to saved consoles. |
| /64 | Opens the 64-bit version of **mmc** (mmc64). Use this option only if you are running a Microsoft 64-bit operating system and want to use a 64-bit snap-in. |
| /32 | Opens the 32-bit version of **mmc** (mmc32). When running a Microsoft 64-bit operating system, you can run 32-bit snap-ins by opening mmc with this command-line option when you have 32-bit only snap-ins. |
| /? | Displays help at the command prompt. |

## Remarks

- You can use environment variables to create command lines or shortcuts that don't depend on the explicit location of console files. For instance, if the path to a console file is in the system folder (for example, **mmc c:\winnt\system32\console_name.msc**), you can use the expandable data string **%systemroot%** to specify the location (**mmc%systemroot%\system32\console_name.msc**). This may be useful if you're delegating tasks to people in your organization who are working on different computers.

- When consoles are opened using the **/a** option, they're opened in author mode, regardless of their default mode. This doesn't permanently change the default mode setting for files; when you omit this option, mmc opens console files according to their default mode settings.

- After you open **mmc** or a console file in author mode, you can open any existing console by clicking **Open** on the **Console** menu.

- You can use the command line to create shortcuts for opening **mmc** and saved consoles. A command-line command works with the **Run** command on the **Start** menu, in any command-prompt window, in shortcuts, or in any batch file or program that calls the command.

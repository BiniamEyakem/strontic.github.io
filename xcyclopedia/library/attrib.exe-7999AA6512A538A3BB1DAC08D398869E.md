These files don\u2019t show up when a user browses the file system with a GUI or when using normal commands on the command line. Users must explicitly ask to show the hidden files either via a series of Graphical User Interface (GUI) prompts or with command line switches (<code>dir \/a<\/code> for Windows and <code>ls \u2013a<\/code> for Linux and macOS).\n\nAdversaries can use this to their advantage to hide files and folders anywhere on the system for persistence and evading a typical user or system analysis that does not incorporate investigation of hidden files.\n\n### Windows\n\nUsers can mark specific files as hidden by using the attrib.exe binary. Simply do <code>attrib +h filename<\/code> to mark a file or folder as hidden. Similarly, the \u201c+s\u201d marks a file as a system file and the \u201c+r\u201d flag marks the file as read only. Like most windows binaries, the attrib.exe binary provides the ability to apply these changes recursively \u201c\/S\u201d.\n\n### Linux\/Mac\n\nUsers can mark specific files as hidden simply by putting a \u201c.\u201d as the first character in the file or folder name  (Citation: Sofacy Komplex Trojan) (Citation: Antiquated Mac Malware). Files and folder that start with a period, \u2018.\u2019, are by default hidden from being viewed in the Finder application and standard command-line utilities like \u201cls\u201d. Users must specifically change settings to have these files viewable. For command line usages, there is typically a flag to see all files (including hidden ones). To view these files in the Finder Application, the following command must be executed: <code>defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES<\/code>, and then relaunch the Finder Application.\n\n### Mac\n\nFiles on macOS can be marked with the UF_HIDDEN flag which prevents them from being seen in Finder.app, but still allows them to be seen in Terminal.app (Citation: WireLurker).\nMany applications create these hidden files and folders to store information so that it doesn\u2019t clutter up the user\u2019s workspace. For example, SSH utilities create a .ssh folder that\u2019s hidden and contains the user\u2019s known hosts and keys.",` | [© ESET 2014-2018](https://github.com/eset/malware-ioc/blob/master/LICENSE)

## attrib

Displays, sets, or removes attributes assigned to files or directories. If used without parameters, **attrib** displays attributes of all files in the current directory.

### Syntax

```
attrib [{+|-}r] [{+|-}a] [{+|-}s] [{+|-}h] [{+|-}i] [<drive>:][<path>][<filename>] [/s [/d] [/l]]
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `{+|-}r` | Sets (**+**) or clears (**-**) the Read-only file attribute. |
| `{+\|-}a` | Sets (**+**) or clears (**-**) the Archive file attribute. This attribute set marks files that have changed since the last time they were backed up. Note that the **xcopy** command uses archive attributes. |
| `{+\|-}s` | Sets (**+**) or clears (**-**) the System file attribute. If a file uses this attribute set, you must clear the attribute before you can change any other attributes for the file. |
| `{+\|-}h` | Sets (**+**) or clears (**-**) the Hidden file attribute. If a file uses this attribute set, you must clear the attribute before you can change any other attributes for the file. |
| `{+\|-}i` | Sets (**+**) or clears (**-**) the Not Content Indexed file attribute. |
| `[<drive>:][<path>][<filename>]` | Specifies the location and name of the directory, file, or group of files for which you want to display or change attributes.<p>You can use the **?** and **&#42;** wildcard characters in the *filename* parameter to display or change the attributes for a group of files. |
| /s | Applies **attrib** and any command-line options to matching files in the current directory and all of its subdirectories. |
| /d | Applies **attrib** and any command-line options to directories. |
| /l | Applies **attrib** and any command-line options to the Symbolic Link, rather than the target of the Symbolic Link. |
| /? | Displays help at the command prompt. |

### Examples

To display the attributes of a file named News86 that is located in the current directory, type:

```
attrib news86
```

To assign the Read-only attribute to the file named report.txt, type:

```
attrib +r report.txt
```

To remove the Read-only attribute from files in the public directory and its subdirectories on a disk in drive b:, type:

```
attrib -r b:\public\*.* /s
```

To set the Archive attribute for all files on drive a:, and then clear the Archive attribute for files with the .bak extension, type:

```
attrib +a a:*.* & attrib -a a:*.bak
```

Scans and verifies the integrity of all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct versions. If this command discovers that a protected file has been overwritten, it retrieves the correct version of the file from the **systemroot\system32\dllcache** folder, and then replaces the incorrect file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must be logged on as a member of the Administrators group to run this command.

### Syntax

```
sfc [/scannow] [/verifyonly] [/scanfile=<file>] [/verifyfile=<file>] [/offwindir=<offline windows directory> /offbootdir=<offline boot directory>]
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|--|--|
| /scannow | Scans the integrity of all protected system files and repairs files with problems when possible. |
| /verifyonly | Scans the integrity of all protected system files, without performing repairs. |

| /verifyfile `<file>` | Verifies the integrity of the specified file (full path and filename), without performing repairs. |

## logoff

> Applies to: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012

Logs off a user from a session on a Remote Desktop Session Host server and deletes the session.

### Syntax
```
logoff [<sessionname> | <sessionID>] [/server:<servername>] [/v]
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `<sessionname>` | Specifies the name of the session. This must be an active session.|
| `<sessionID>` | Specifies the numeric ID which identifies the session to the server. |
| /server:`<servername>` | Specifies the Remote Desktop Session Host server that contains the session whose user you want to log off. If unspecified, the server on which you are currently active is used. |
| /v | Displays information about the actions being performed. |
| /? | Displays help at the command prompt. |

##### Remarks

- You can always log off yourself from the session to which you are currently logged on. You must, however, have **Full Control** permission to log off users from other sessions.

- Logging off a user from a session without warning can result in loss of data at the user's session. You should send a message to the user by using the **msg** command to warn the user before taking this action.

- If `<sessionID>` or `<sessionname>` isn't specified, **logoff** logs the user off from the current session.

- After you log off a user, all processes end and the session is deleted from the server.

- You can't log off a user from the console session.

#### Examples

To log off a user from the current session, type:

```
logoff
```

To log off a user from a session by using the session's ID, for example *session 12*, type:

```
logoff 12
```

To log off a user from a session by using the name of the session and server, for example session *TERM04* on *Server1*, type:

```
logoff TERM04 /server:Server1
```

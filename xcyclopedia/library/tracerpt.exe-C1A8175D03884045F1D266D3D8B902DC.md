## tracerpt

The **tracerpt** command parses Event Trace Logs, log files generated by Performance Monitor, and real-time Event Trace providers. It also generates dump files, report files, and report schemas.

### Syntax

```
tracerpt <[-l] <value [value [...]]>|-rt <session_name [session_name [...]]>> [options]
```

#### Parameters

| Parameters | Description |
|--|--|
| -config `<filename>` | Specifies which settings file to load, which includes your command options. |
| -y | Specifies to answer **yes** to all questions, without prompting. |
| -f `<XML | HTML>` | Specifies the report file format. |
| -of `<CSV | EVTX | XML>` | Specifies the dump file format. The default is **XML*. |
| -df `<filename>` | Specifies to create a Microsoft-specific counting/reporting schema file. |
| -int `<filename>` | Specifies to dump the interpreted event structure to the specified file. |
| -rts | Specifies to add the report raw timestamp in the event trace header. Can only be used with **-o**. It's not supported with **-report** or **-summary**. |
| -tmf `<filename>` | Specifies which Trace Message Format definition file to use. |
| -tp `<value>` | Specifies the TMF file search path. Multiple paths may be used, separated by a semicolon (;). |
| -i `<value>` | Specifies the provider image path. The matching PDB will be located in the Symbol Server. Multiple paths can be used, separated by a semicolon (;). |
| -pdb `<value>` | Specifies the symbol server path. Multiple paths can be used, separated by a semicolon (;). |
| -gmt | Specifies to convert WPP payload timestamps to Greenwich Mean Time. |

| -report [filename] | Specifies to create a text output report file. The filename, if not specified, is *workload.xml*. |
| -lr | Specifies to be less restrictive. This uses best efforts for events that don't match the events schema. |
| -export [filename] | Specifies to create an Event Schema export file. The filename, if not specified, is *schema.man*. |
| [-l] `<value [value [â€¦]]>` | Specifies the Event Trace log file to process. |
| -rt `<session_name [session_name [â€¦]]>` | Specifies the Real-time Event Trace Session data sources. |
| -? | Displays help at the command prompt. |

### Examples

To create a report based on the two event logs *logfile1.etl* and *logfile2.etl*, and to create the dump file *logdump.xml* in *XML* format, type:

```
tracerpt logfile1.etl logfile2.etl -o logdump.xml -of XML
```

To create a report based on the event log *logfile.etl*, to create the dump file *logdmp.xml* in XML format, to use best efforts to identify events not in the schema, and to produce a summary report file *logdump.txt* and a report file, *logrpt.xml*, type:

```
tracerpt logfile.etl -o logdmp.xml -of XML -lr -summary logdmp.txt -report logrpt.xml
```

To use the two event logs *logfile1.etl* and *logfile2.etl* to produce a dump file, and to report file with the default filenames, type:

```
tracerpt logfile1.etl logfile2.etl -o -report
```

To use the event log *logfile.etl* and the performance log *counterfile.blg* to produce the report file *logrpt.xml* and the Microsoft-specific XML schema file *schema.xml*, type:

```
tracerpt logfile.etl counterfile.blg -report logrpt.xml -df schema.xml
```

To read the real-time Event Trace Session NT Kernel Logger and to produce the dump file *logfile.csv* in *CSV* format, type:

```
tracerpt -rt NT Kernel Logger -o logfile.csv -of CSV
```

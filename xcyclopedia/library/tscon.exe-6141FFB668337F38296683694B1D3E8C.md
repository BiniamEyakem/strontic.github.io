Typically, a user is notified when someone else is trying to steal their session. With System permissions and using Terminal Services Console, `c:\windows\system32\tscon.exe [session number to be stolen]`, an adversary can hijack a session without the need for credentials or prompts to the user.(Citation: RDP Hijacking Korznikov) This can be done remotely or locally and with active or disconnected sessions.(Citation: RDP Hijacking Medium) It can also lead to [Remote System Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1018) and Privilege Escalation by stealing a Domain Admin or higher privileged account session. All of this can be done by using native Windows commands, but it has also been added as a feature in red teaming tools.(Citation: Kali Redsnarf)</blockquote> | [MIT License. © 2018 Red Canary](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)

### Syntax

```
tscon {<sessionID> | <sessionname>} [/dest:<sessionname>] [/password:<pw> | /password:*] [/v]
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|--|--|
| `<sessionID>` | Specifies the ID of the session to which you want to connect. If you use the optional `/dest:<sessionname>` parameter, you can also specify the name of the current session. |
| `<sessionname>` | Specifies the name of the session to which you want to connect. |
| /dest:`<sessionname>` | Specifies the name of the current session. This session will disconnect when you connect to the new session. You can also use this parameter to connect the session of another user to a different session. |
| /password:`<pw>` | Specifies the password of the user who owns the session to which you want to connect. This password is required when the connecting user does not own the session. |
| /password:`*` | Prompts for the password of the user who owns the session to which you want to connect. |
| /v | Displays information about the actions being performed. |
| /? | Displays help at the command prompt. |

- This command fails if you don't specify a password in the **/password** parameter, and the target session belongs to a user other than the current one.

- You can't connect to the console session.

### Examples

To connect to *Session 12* on the current Remote Desktop Services Session Host server, and to disconnect the current session, type:

```
tscon 12
```

To connect to *Session 23* on the current Remote Desktop Services Session Host server using the password *mypass*, and to disconnect the current session, type:

```
tscon 23 /password:mypass
```

To connect the session named *TERM03* to the session named *TERM05*, and then to disconnect session *TERM05*, type:

```
tscon TERM03 /v /dest:TERM05
```

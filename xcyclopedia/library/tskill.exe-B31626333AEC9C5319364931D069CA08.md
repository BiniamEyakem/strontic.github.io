## tskill

> Applies to: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012

Ends a process running in a session on a Remote Desktop Session Host server.


> [!NOTE]
> In Windows Server 2008 R2, Terminal Services was renamed Remote Desktop Services. To find out what's new in the latest version, see [What s New in Remote Desktop Services in Windows Server 2012](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh831527) in the Windows Server TechNet Library.

### Syntax
```
tskill {<ProcessID> | <ProcessName>} [/server:<ServerName>] [/id:<SessionID> | /a] [/v]
```

#### Parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|-------|--------|
|\<ProcessID>|Specifies the ID of the process that you want to end.|
|\<ProcessName>|Specifies the name of the process that you want to end. This parameter can include wildcard characters.|
|/server:\<ServerName>|Specifies the terminal server that contains the process that you want to end. If **/server** is not specified, the current RD Session Host server is used.|
|/id:\<SessionID>|Ends the process that is running in the specified session.|
|/a|Ends the process that is running in all sessions.|
|/v|Displays information about the actions being performed.|
|/?|Displays help at the command prompt.|

### Remarks
- You can use **tskill** to end only those processes that belong to you, unless you are an administrator. Administrators have full access to all **tskill** functions and can end processes that are running in other user sessions.
- When all processes that are running in a session end, the session also ends.
- if you use the *ProcessName* and the **/server:**<em>ServerName</em> parameters, you must also specify either the **/id:**<em>SessionID</em> or the **/a** parameter.

### Examples
- To end process 6543, type:
  ```
  tskill 6543
  ```
- To end the process explorer running on session 5, type:
  ```
  tskill explorer /id:5
  ```

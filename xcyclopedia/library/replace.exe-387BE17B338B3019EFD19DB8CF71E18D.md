# replace



Replaces files. If used with the **/a** option, **replace** adds new files to a directory instead of replacing existing files.



## Syntax

```
replace [<Drive1>:][<Path1>]<FileName> [<Drive2>:][<Path2>] [/a] [/p] [/r] [/w] 
replace [<Drive1>:][<Path1>]<FileName> [<Drive2>:][<Path2>] [/p] [/r] [/s] [/w] [/u] 
```

### Parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|[\<Drive1>:][\<Path1>]\<FileName>|Specifies the location and name of the source file or set of files. *FileName* is required, and can include wildcard characters (**&#42;** and **?**).|
|[\<Drive2>:][\<Path2>]|Specifies the location of the destination file. You cannot specify a file name for files you replace. If you do not specify a drive or path, **replace** uses the current drive and directory as the destination.|
|/a|Adds new files to the destination directory instead of replacing existing files. You cannot use this command-line option with the **/s** or **/u** command-line option.|
|/p|Prompts you for confirmation before replacing a destination file or adding a source file.|
|/r|Replaces Read-only and unprotected files. If you attempt to replace a Read-only file, but you do not specify **/r**, an error results and stops the replacement operation.|
|/w|Waits for you to insert a disk before the search for source files begins. If you do not specify **/w**, **replace** begins replacing or adding files immediately after you press ENTER.|
|/s|Searches all subdirectories in the destination directory and replaces matching files. You cannot use **/s** with the **/a** command-line option. The **replace** command does not search subdirectories that are specified in *Path1*.|
|/u|Replaces only those files on the destination directory that are older than those in the source directory. You cannot use **/u** with the **/a** command-line option.|
|/?|Displays help at the command prompt.|

## Remarks

- As **replace** adds or replaces files, the file names are displayed on the screen. After **replace** is finished, a summary line is displayed in one of the following formats:  
  ```
  nnn files added
  nnn files replaced
  no file added
  no file replaced
  ```  
- If you are using floppy disks and you need to switch disks during the **replace** operation, you can specify the **/w** command-line option so that **replace** will wait for you to switch the disks.
- You cannot use **replace** to update hidden files or system files.
- The following table shows each exit code and a brief description of its meaning:  
  |Exit code|Description|
  |---------|-----------|
  |0|The **replace** command successfully replaced or added the files.|
  |1|The **replace** command encountered an incorrect version of MS-DOS.|
  |2|The **replace** command could not find the source files.|
  |3|The **replace** command could not find the source or destination path.|
  |5|The user does not have access to the files that you want to replace.|
  |8|There is insufficient system memory to carry out the command.|
  |11|The user used the wrong syntax on the command line.|

> [!NOTE]
> You can use the ERRORLEVEL parameter on the **if** command line in a batch program to process exit codes that are returned by **replace**.

## <a name="BKMK_examples"></a>Examples

To update all the versions of a file named Phones.cli (which appear in multiple directories on drive C), with the latest version of the Phones.cli file from a floppy disk in drive A, type:

`replace a:\phones.cli c:\ /s`
